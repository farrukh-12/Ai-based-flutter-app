AI-Based Food App
This is a smart, AI-powered food app that helps users find meal suggestions, recipes, and personalized nutrition recommendations based on their preferences, dietary restrictions, and previous choices. The app uses machine learning algorithms to recommend recipes, track user preferences, and provide tailored food recommendations.

Features
Recipe Suggestions: Personalized meal suggestions based on user preferences and dietary needs.
Nutritional Information: Detailed nutritional information for each recipe.
Ingredient Substitutions: AI-driven ingredient substitutions based on availability or dietary restrictions.
Meal Planning: Helps users plan their weekly meals and create shopping lists.
Food Image Recognition (Optional): Detects food items from images and suggests recipes based on what’s available in the fridge.
Voice Assistance (Optional): Users can ask the app to suggest meals or ingredients through voice commands.
Tech Stack
Backend: Python (Flask/Django/FastAPI)
Frontend: React Native or React.js (for mobile/web apps)
Machine Learning/AI: TensorFlow, Keras, or PyTorch for recommendation models
Database: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or Firebase (depending on the app’s structure)
API: RESTful APIs for communication between frontend and backend
Cloud: AWS/GCP/Azure for deployment and scalability
External APIs (Optional): Spoonacular API for recipes, nutritional data, and food databases.
